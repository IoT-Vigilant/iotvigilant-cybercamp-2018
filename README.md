# iotvigilant-cybercamp-2018

IoTVigilant is an Open Source development created to detect weird network behaviors of IoT devices --or of any device with low network interaction--.

## Why is this needed?

Nowadays, more and more IoT devices are being used and, as these devices aren't created with security in mind, they suppose a huge security risk in the cyber world. For example, in 2016 Miraia was a IoT botnet whose size vary from 800,000 infected devices to 2.5 million and was used to perform DDoS attacks to some Internet services.

in spite of the size of this botnet, it isn't the biggest IoT botnet that has been used to perform attacks. This is why we think that this proyect is needed to discover when a IoT device is behaving in a weird way to stop it.

## The network

As the user of an IoT device rarely has access to the source code of this device and can't install any security meassure inside  it, the best way to discover that the gadget has been infected and is perfeorming unexpected actions, is monitoring the network were it is connected.
